# CM Tekton Tasks

This is a workshop repo to hold a number of in-development Tekton tasks that utilize the [cm-cli](https://github.com/open-cluster-management/cm-cli) to interact with ACM/OCM APIs.  Some tasks we hope to workshop here include ClusterPool checkout and checkin, cluster attach, and other CI-useful tasks.  

## Useful Documentation

The OpenShift CLI Task contains [some useful information on ServiceAccount configuration](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/main/task/openshift-client/0.2#serviceaccount).
